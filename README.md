This package lets INLS161 students install the TeXLive packages necessary for using Pandoc to create PDFs. 

You can clone the repostitory into your DevBox as follows:

`git clone git@github.com:INLS161Su2015/install-tl-inls161.git`

The installation.profile file is intended to ease the process of installing a minimal TeXLive in your CodeAnywhere DevBox. 

In order to do this you will need to run the installer as follows:

`sudo ./tl-install`

This tell you that the installer has found a profile from a previous install attempt and ask if you want to install exactly as before. 

Type `Y` and hit enter and it will begin the install. 

The minimal install should take only a few minutes.
